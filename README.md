# QuantumComputingProject

A quantum computing project done with two other students during my engineer cycle. The project consisted of the development of a RSA cipher and a Shor algorithm able to break it using Python (mainly numpy, matplotlib and qiskit). The numbers used in this quantum simulation are voluntarily small to avoid very long execution time.

For more information on the project please consider checking the report. It is curently in french, but an english version may arrive soon.

# QuantumComputingProject

A quantum computing project done with two other students during my engineer cycle. The project consisted of the development of a RSA cipher and a Shor algorithm able to break it using Python (mainly numpy, matplotlib and qiskit).

For more information on the project please consider checking the report. It is curently in french, but an english version may arrive soon.
